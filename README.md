# BMC Engine

A game engine, built from the ground up in C/C++

## Compiling
This only works on Windows **for now.** We are working on other OSes.

### 1. Install CMake
Head [here](https://cmake.org/download/) to get CMake. Any version **newer than 3.8** should work.

### 2. Download Repository
Go to the repository page (you should already be here) and click the green "Code" button. Then, click "Download ZIP." Once the file is downloaded, simply just extract the zip.
